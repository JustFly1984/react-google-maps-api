/**
 * @name MarkerWithLabel for V3
 * @version 1.1.9 [June 30, 2013]
 * @author Gary Little (inspired by code from Marc Ridey of Google).
 * @copyright Copyright 2012 Gary Little [gary at luxcentral.com]
 * @fileoverview MarkerWithLabel extends the Google Maps JavaScript API V3
 *  <code>google.maps.Marker</code> class.
 *  <p>
 *  MarkerWithLabel allows you to define markers with associated labels. As you would expect,
 *  if the marker is draggable, so too will be the label. In addition, a marker with a label
 *  responds to all mouse events in the same manner as a regular marker. It also fires mouse
 *  events and "property changed" events just as a regular marker would. Version 1.1 adds
 *  support for the raiseOnDrag feature introduced in API V3.3.
 *  <p>
 *  If you drag a marker by its label, you can cancel the drag and return the marker to its
 *  original position by pressing the <code>Esc</code> key. This doesn't work if you drag the marker
 *  itself because this feature is not (yet) supported in the <code>google.maps.Marker</code> class.
